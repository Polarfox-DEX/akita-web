    <p>
      Polarfox is built on Avalanche because it uses a revolutionary consensus model that completes transactions with
      near-instantaneous finality.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>To put it simply, Avalanche has:</p>

    <ul className="list-disc ml-1 list-inside">
      <li>Ridiculously low gas fees;</li>
      <li>Extremely fast transactions;</li>
      <li>A responsive dev team;</li>
      <li>A dedicated community.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>We believe Avalanche is underrated, and will see major growth over the coming years.</p>
