    <p>
      Polarfox Labs, first known as the Polarfox Project, was born out of a deep need: the AKITA token was lacking a
      team and a project.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Various members from the community came together to build a project from scratch who eventually formed the
      Polarfox Labs team. Integrating Akita into a decentralized social network was a community decision. As developers
      began to understand the complexities of building a social network while working on Ethereum, a new idea was born:
      Polarfox.

    <p>
      Polarfox Labs will build an ecosystem centered around a DEX to bolster the development of future projects in the
      ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polarfox will first create a DEX. This will solve the main issue for building DeFi products, which is sufficient
      liquidity. The DEX will as well act as the main source of funds for the dev team to further develop the ecosystem.
