    <p>Currently: 95 trillion AKITA (95,000,000,000,000).</p>

    <br />

    <p>
      When $AKITA was first minted, it had a limited supply of 100 trillion tokens, and half of this amount was sent to
      Vitalik Buterin, the co-Founder of Ethereum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the original token creator burned 5 trillion of those tokens, as well as the keys to the contract,
      so no more could be minted.
    </p>

    <p>No further burns or deflationary elements for $AKITA are expected.</p>

    <br />

    <p>
      In May 2021, Vitalik Buterin was concerned about the security of his wallet and any potential negative effects of
      holding so much $AKITA.
    </p>

    <p>
      He decided to send a small part (~0.7%) to COVID relief funds in India, and then donated the majority of his
      holdings to GitCoin, an open source project fund.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      GitCoin is currently discussing with the AKITA Network team how to best use these tokens while best maintaining
      the original tokenomics of $AKITA.
    </p>
    <p>When the plan has been decided, the team will post an update here and in all social channels.</p>
