    <p>When holders provide liquidity through DreamSwap, they will earn DREAM tokens.</p>
    <p>The DREAM token will be deployed on Ethereum Network with a total supply of 33,600,000 units.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      At its genesis, the distribution will be 1.5M DREAM tokens, of which 1M will be deployed in the community through
      mechanisms such as drops.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The other 500K DREAM will be locked specifically for team funding. Among those, a weekly allocation of 10,000
      DREAM will be automatically sent to a treasury wallet, where it will remain locked until the AKITA Network
      community decides what to do with the funds.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Finally, an additional weekly distribution of 52,000 DREAM will be evenly split between pools.</p>
    <br />
    <p>It is also possible to earn DREAM and additional rewards by staking AKITA tokens.</p>
    <p>
      0.25% of AKITA deposits on the protocol return to the staker’s AKITA savings wallet with a nominal annual
      percentage yield.
