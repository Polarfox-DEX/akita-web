    The Polarfox / Akita team has been working on the Polarfox DEX, the bridge, the websites, DreamSwap and so on since
    February, without any funding. Most of the team members still work part-time and on weekends. We expect to make our
    own funding in two ways:
    <ul className="list-disc ml-1 list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>By keeping a small percentage of the PFX token supply when starting the project;</li>
      <li>
        By having 0.03% fees on every transaction involving the PFX token. Coupled to the deflationary nature of PFX,
        this should be enough by itself to fund the team.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </>
