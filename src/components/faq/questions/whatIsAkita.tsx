      AKITA (Akita Inu) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain defined{' '}

      .

    <br />
    <p>
      Originally a meme token without a team nor a project, acting as Doge's and Shiba Inu's smaller brother, it now has
      a strong community of 45,000+ holders, a dedicated team known as Polarfox Labs, and many moderators to help
      federate the community.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      The goal of the team is to convert this coin from a meme token to a real, useful token with various use cases.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Three projects involving AKITA are being worked on as of May 2021:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-1 list-inside">
      <li>The DreamSwap exchange on Ethereum, which will allow you to stake your AKITA with other dog tokens;</li>
      <li>
        An Avalanche / Ethereum bridge, which will let you send your AKITA from Ethereum to Avalanche and vice-versa;
      </li>
      <li>
        The Polarfox decentralized exchange, the main project of the team, on the Avalanche blockchain. involves AKITA
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p>The Polarfox decentralized exchange involves AKITA in a few ways at once:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc ml-1 list-inside">
      <li>A certain amount of AKITA tokens will be required to access the pre-sale of PFX (Polarfox) tokens;</li>
      <li>The AKITA governance token, known as gAKITA, will be earned there;</li>
      <li>The AKITA governance will be implemented on Polarfox.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <p>Good progress has been made on all three of those projects, and will release most probably in June or July.</p>
