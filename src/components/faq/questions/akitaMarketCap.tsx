    <p>100 trillion AKITA.</p>

    <p>Half of this amount was originally sent to Vitalik Buterin.</p>
    <p>
      In May 2021, he decided to send a small part of it to covid relief funds in India, while sending the majority to
      GitCoin, an open source project fund. GitCoin has not decided what to do with the tokens yet, and our team is in
      contact with theirs to discuss what would the next steps be.
